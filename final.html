                    Deep in the northern mountains of the Cadia Riverlands lies a quiet and peaceful village. This village is home to the legendary Tianyin Swordmaster Sect, and is also the place where Duan Meng spent his childhood perfecting his technique. As soon as he was old enough to pick up a bamboo sword, Duan Meng was determined to become a great swordmaster.

                    Alucard is a very strong hero, when he is sufficiently farmed, especially when he is ahead in farm. He is able to burst down the squishy enemy heroes within mere seconds and yet still have the ability to continue fighting in fights with the low cooldown of his skills, bringing the team to victory if played right.
